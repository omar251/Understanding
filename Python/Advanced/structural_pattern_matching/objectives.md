## Structural Pattern Matching

This section covers structural pattern matching, a powerful feature introduced in Python 3.10 for matching against the structure of data.

*   `basics.py`: Introduces the basic syntax of `match` and `case` statements. Covers matching literal values, variables, wildcards, and simple patterns.
*   `class_instances.py`: Demonstrates how to match against class instances, including matching on class type and attributes.
*   `git.py`: (Likely a practical example using git commands) - Uses pattern matching to parse and process output from git commands.
*   `json_data.py`: (Likely a practical example using JSON data) - Shows how to use pattern matching to process data loaded from JSON files.

The objective is to learn how to use pattern matching to write concise and readable code when working with complex data structures, making it easier to extract information and perform conditional logic based on the structure of the data.

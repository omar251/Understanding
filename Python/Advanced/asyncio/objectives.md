## Asyncio

This section explores asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` library, enabling concurrent operation without the limitations of threads or processes.

*   `intro.py`: Introduces fundamental asyncio concepts like asynchronous functions (`async def`), event loops, `await`, and tasks.  Illustrates basic asynchronous operations.

*   `site_status.py`: Likely demonstrates fetching the status of multiple websites concurrently using `asyncio` for improved performance compared to synchronous approaches.  Shows effective handling of I/O-bound tasks.

*   `sync_in_async.py`:  Explores how to integrate synchronous code with asynchronous code using `asyncio.to_thread` or similar techniques to handle blocking operations while maintaining concurrency.

The objective is to understand the fundamentals of asynchronous programming with `asyncio` and apply it to handle I/O-bound tasks concurrently.  This improves performance and responsiveness, especially in applications dealing with network requests or other external operations that can be made non-blocking.

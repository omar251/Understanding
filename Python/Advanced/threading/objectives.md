## Threading

This section explores threading in Python, a way to achieve concurrency by running multiple threads within a single process.

*   `intro.py`: Introduces the basic concepts of threading, including creating threads using the `threading` module, starting and stopping threads, and joining threads. Explains the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications for true parallelism in Python.
*   `downloader.py`: (Likely a practical example of a multithreaded downloader) - Demonstrates using threads to download multiple files concurrently, showcasing thread management and potentially handling potential issues like race conditions.
*   `site_status.py`: Likely uses threads to check the status of multiple websites concurrently.
*   `deadlocker.py`: (Likely demonstrates a deadlock scenario) - Illustrates a common problem in concurrent programming and how to avoid deadlocks.
*   `status_report.txt`: (Likely output from a threading example) - A sample file illustrating the results of a multithreaded operation.

The objective is to understand the basics of threading in Python, how to create and manage threads, and to learn how to handle potential issues that can arise from concurrent execution like race conditions and deadlocks.  It also introduces the limitations imposed by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

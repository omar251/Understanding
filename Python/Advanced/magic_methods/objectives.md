## Magic Methods

This section delves into Python's magic methods (also known as dunder methods, as they have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names), which allow you to customize how your objects interact with built-in functions and operators.

*   `magic_methods.py`: Covers implementing various magic methods such as `__init__` (constructor), `__str__` (string representation), `__repr__` (representation), `__len__` (length), `__getitem__` (item access), `__setitem__` (item assignment), `__delitem__` (item deletion), arithmetic operators (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc.), comparison operators (`__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, etc.), and more.

The objective is to learn how to control the behavior of your objects in a wide range of contexts, making them more intuitive and Pythonic.

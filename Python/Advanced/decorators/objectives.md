## Decorators

This section covers decorators, a powerful and elegant feature in Python that allows you to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods in a reusable way.

*   `decorators.py`: Covers the basics of decorator syntax using the `@` symbol, creating decorators that take no arguments, decorators that take arguments, and applying multiple decorators to a single function. Explores the use cases of decorators, such as logging, timing, access control, memoization, and more.

The objective is to learn how to use and create decorators to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code by separating concerns and adding functionality to existing functions without modifying their core logic.

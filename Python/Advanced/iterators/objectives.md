## Iterators

This section dives deeper into the concept of iterators in Python, exploring how they work and how to create custom iterators.

*   `iterators.py`: Covers the iterator protocol (the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods), creating custom iterators, and understanding the relationship between iterables, iterators, and the `for` loop.

The objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of iterators, which will enable you to work with and create custom iterable objects and optimize iteration-based code.

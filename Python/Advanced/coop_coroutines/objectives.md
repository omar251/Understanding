## Cooperative Coroutines

This section explores cooperative multitasking in Python using coroutines, a lightweight concurrency mechanism.  Cooperative multitasking relies on coroutines voluntarily yielding control to other coroutines, enabling concurrency without threads or processes.

*   `coop_coros.py`: Introduces the concept of cooperative coroutines, demonstrating their creation and use. Shows how coroutines yield control using `yield` and how to manage their execution flow.  Explores different strategies for cooperative concurrency, emphasizing the importance of coroutines voluntarily relinquishing control.

The objective is to understand cooperative multitasking as a concurrency technique and learn how to design and implement cooperative coroutines in Python. This approach is often suitable for tasks with significant I/O operations and can be beneficial for resource-constrained environments, but emphasizes the need for careful design to prevent one coroutine from monopolizing resources.

## Generators

This section covers generators, a powerful feature in Python for creating iterators efficiently. Generators use the `yield` keyword to produce a sequence of values on demand.

*   `generators.py`: Introduces generator functions (functions that use `yield`), generator expressions (similar to list comprehensions, but using parentheses), and the benefits of using generators for memory efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.

The objective is to learn how to create and use generators to write more memory-efficient and elegant code, especially for iterative tasks.

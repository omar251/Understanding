## Context Managers

This section explores context managers, a Python feature that simplifies resource management (e.g., files, network connections) by ensuring resources are properly acquired and released, even in the presence of exceptions.

*   `context.py`: Covers the `with` statement, which is the primary way to use context managers. Demonstrates creating custom context managers using the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator or by implementing the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in a class. Explains the benefits of context managers, such as automatic resource cleanup and improved code readability.

The objective is to learn how to use and create context managers to write more robust, readable, and maintainable code, especially when dealing with resources that need to be properly initialized and cleaned up.

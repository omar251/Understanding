## Descriptors

This section explores descriptors, a more advanced feature in Python that allows you to customize attribute access (getting, setting, and deleting) in classes. Descriptors provide a way to add custom logic to these operations.

*   `descriptors.py`: Covers the implementation of descriptors using the `__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__` methods. Demonstrates different types of descriptors (data descriptors and non-data descriptors), and how they are used to control attribute access. Explains use cases for descriptors, such as managing attribute validation, adding calculated properties, and implementing lazy loading.

The objective is to understand how to use descriptors to create powerful and flexible classes with customized attribute behavior, allowing you to build more sophisticated and reusable code.

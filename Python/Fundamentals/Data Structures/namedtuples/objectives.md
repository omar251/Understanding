## Namedtuples

This section explores the use of `namedtuple` from the `collections` module, a convenient way to create lightweight, immutable classes for data structures.

*   `named_tuples.py`: Introduces the basics of creating and using `namedtuple` objects, including defining the fields and accessing their values by name.
*   `comparison.py`: Compares `namedtuple` with regular classes, highlighting their differences in terms of mutability and memory usage.
*   `inheritance.py`: Shows how to create subclasses of `namedtuple` for specialized data structures.
*   `products.csv`: (Example data) - A sample CSV file likely used to demonstrate how to store and use product data.
*   `products.py`: (Likely demonstrates using namedtuples with product data) - Provides a practical example of using `namedtuple` to represent and manipulate product information, potentially reading from the CSV file.

The objective is to learn how to use `namedtuple` to create simple, immutable classes that enhance code readability and reduce boilerplate code.

## Strings

This section is dedicated to understanding and manipulating string data in Python.

*   `basics.py`: Covers fundamental string creation, representation, and basic properties.
*   `altering.py`: Demonstrates methods for changing or modifying strings.
*   `formatting.py`: Explores different ways to format strings, including f-strings, `.format()`, and older methods.
*   `splitting_strings.py`: Shows how to break strings into smaller parts based on delimiters.
*   `strings_like_lists.py`: Highlights the similarities between strings and lists, such as indexing and slicing.
*   `testing_contents.py`: Covers methods for checking the content of strings (e.g., isalpha(), isdigit()).
*   `translation_tables.py`: Explains how to use `str.maketrans()` and `str.translate()` for character substitution.

The objective is to become proficient in working with text data, a common task in many programming scenarios.

## Functions

This section focuses on defining and using functions to create reusable blocks of code in Python.

*   `beginner.py`: Introduces the basic syntax of function definition, function calls, parameters, and return values.
*   `intermediate.py`: Covers more advanced function concepts like default argument values, keyword arguments, variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs), and function annotations.
*   `advanced.py`:  Explores higher-order functions, lambda expressions, closures, and decorators (though decorators also have their own section).

The objective is to learn how to structure your code effectively by breaking it down into modular, reusable functions.

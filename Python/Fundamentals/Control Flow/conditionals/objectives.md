## Conditionals

This section covers the use of conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to control the flow of execution in Python based on different conditions.

*   `conditionals.py`: Demonstrates basic `if`, `elif`, and `else` constructs for making decisions in code.
*   `inline.py`: Shows how to use inline `if` statements (ternary operators) for concise conditional expressions.

The objective is to understand how to execute different code blocks depending on whether certain conditions are true or false.

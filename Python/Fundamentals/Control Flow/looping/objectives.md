## Looping

This section covers the use of loops (`for` and `while`) to repeat code blocks in Python.

*   `for_loops.py`: Demonstrates how to use `for` loops to iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges) and other iterable objects.
*   `while_loops.py`: Shows how to use `while` loops to repeat code as long as a certain condition remains true.

The objective is to understand how to automate repetitive tasks by using loops effectively.

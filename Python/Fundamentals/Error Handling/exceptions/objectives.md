## Exceptions

This section covers exception handling in Python, which is crucial for writing robust and reliable code.

*   `exceptions.py`: Covers the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. Demonstrates how to catch specific exceptions, handle exceptions gracefully, raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword, create custom exception classes, and understand exception hierarchies.

The objective is to learn how to anticipate and handle potential errors in your code, preventing program crashes and ensuring that your applications behave predictably, even in the face of unexpected issues.

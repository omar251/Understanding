## Inheritance

This section builds upon the concepts introduced in "Basic Classes" by exploring inheritance, a fundamental mechanism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for creating new classes based on existing ones.

*   `inheritance.py`: Covers creating subclasses, inheriting attributes and methods from parent classes, overriding methods in subclasses, using `super()` to call parent class methods, and understanding the "is-a" relationship.

The objective is to learn how to reuse and extend existing code by creating specialized classes that inherit properties and behaviors from more general classes.

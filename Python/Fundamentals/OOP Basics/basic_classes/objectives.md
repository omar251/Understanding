## Basic Classes

This section introduces the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python through the creation and use of basic classes.

*   `classes.py`: Covers defining classes, creating instances (objects) of classes, defining attributes (data) and methods (functions) within a class, the `self` parameter, and the constructor (`__init__`) method.

The objective is to understand the core concepts of OOP, including how to model real-world entities as objects with data and behavior.

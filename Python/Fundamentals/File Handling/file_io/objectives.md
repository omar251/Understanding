## File I/O

This section covers how to read data from and write data to files in Python.

*   `files.py`: Covers opening files, reading data line by line or all at once, writing data to files, closing files properly (using `with`), and handling different file modes (read, write, append).
*   `binary_file`: (Example of a binary file?) - Likely provides an example of reading and/or writing binary data to a file.
*   `names.txt`: (Example text file) - A sample text file used for demonstration purposes.
*   `new_file.txt`: (Example text file) - Another sample text file potentially used for writing examples.

The objective is to learn how to interact with the file system to read data from existing files and create or modify new files.

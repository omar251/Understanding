## Comprehensions

This section introduces list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions, which provide a concise way to create new collections from existing iterables.

*   `beginner.py`: Covers the basics of list comprehensions, demonstrating how to create new lists based on a for loop and an optional conditional.
*   `intermediate.py`: Explores more advanced comprehension techniques, including nested comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions.

The objective is to learn how to use comprehensions to write more efficient and readable code when creating and manipulating collections.

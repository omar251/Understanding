## Slicing

This section focuses on slicing, a powerful feature in Python for extracting portions of sequences (strings, lists, tuples) or other iterable objects.

*   `slicing.py`: Covers the syntax of slicing using the colon (`:`) operator, including start, stop, and step parameters. Demonstrates how to create slices, access elements within a slice, and perform slice assignments. Explains negative indexing and step values.

The objective is to understand how to effectively extract subsets of data from sequences using slicing, which is a common and efficient operation in Python programming.

## Debugging

This section focuses on techniques and tools for identifying and fixing errors (bugs) in your Python code.

*   `student_report.py`: (Likely the script to debug) - Contains code with potential issues.
*   `grades.json`: (Likely data used for a debugging example) - Data used by the script.

The objective is to learn how to use debugging tools (like `pdb` or IDE debuggers), read and understand error messages, and apply debugging strategies to find and resolve bugs in your code effectively.

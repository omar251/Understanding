## Map Filter

This section focuses on the `map()` and `filter()` functions in Python, which are functional programming tools for transforming and filtering data in iterables.

*   `map_filter.py`: Covers the usage of `map()` to apply a function to each item in an iterable, and `filter()` to select items from an iterable based on a condition. Demonstrates the use of lambda functions with `map()` and `filter()`.

The objective is to understand and use `map()` and `filter()` for efficient data manipulation and to appreciate functional programming paradigms.

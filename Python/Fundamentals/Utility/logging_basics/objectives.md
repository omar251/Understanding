## Logging Basics

This section introduces the basics of logging in Python, a crucial practice for monitoring and debugging applications.

*   `myapp.py`: Demonstrates how to use the `logging` module to record events and information, including different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), formatting log messages, and configuring basic logging to the console or a file.

The objective is to learn how to implement logging in your Python code to track the execution of your programs, identify issues, and provide valuable information for debugging and monitoring.

## Getting Started

This section introduces the absolute fundamentals of writing Python code.

*   `hello.py`: Covers the basic structure of a Python program, often starting with a simple "hello world" example.
*   `helper.py`: Demonstrates how to organize code into separate files (modules) and potentially how to import and use functions from them.

The objective is to get comfortable with executing simple Python scripts and understanding basic file organization.

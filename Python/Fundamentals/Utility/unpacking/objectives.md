## Unpacking

This section covers unpacking, a versatile feature in Python that allows you to assign elements from iterables (like lists, tuples, and strings) to multiple variables in a single statement.

*   `unpacking.py`: Covers the basic syntax of unpacking, including:
    *   Unpacking tuples, lists, and strings.
    *   Using the asterisk (`*`) operator to capture multiple values into a single variable (e.g., `a, *b, c`).
    *   Unpacking in function arguments.
    *   Unpacking in loops.

The objective is to learn how to use unpacking to write more concise and readable code, especially when working with data structures and function arguments.
